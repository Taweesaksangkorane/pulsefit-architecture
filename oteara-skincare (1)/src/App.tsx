                    Whether in a boardroom, a studio, or on an intensive long shift, your day is a marathon. Stress, sleepless nights, and city pollution take a visible toll—often manifesting as tired eyes, fatigued skin, and dull, weighed-down hair.

                    Hours of screen light and dry office air drain moisture from your eyes and skin, while city smog and UV rays cling to your hair. By the afternoon, eyes often look dark, skin loses its natural bounce, and hair feels heavy and lifeless from the day's pressure.
